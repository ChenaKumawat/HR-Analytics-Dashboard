**HR Analytics Dashboard: Insights and Learnings**
This HR analytics dashboard was developed to address key challenges in employee retention, hiring processes, and productivity optimization. By analyzing workforce data across various dimensions, we identified actionable insights that significantly improve organizational HR strategies.

**Key Achievements:**
**Identified Key Factors to Reduce Attrition:** Through detailed data analysis, we pinpointed the critical factors that contribute to employee attrition. This included a comprehensive examination of employee demographics, performance, engagement levels, and feedback.

**Improved the Hiring Process:** By leveraging insights from the dashboard, we identified gaps in the hiring process that contributed to higher turnover rates. This allowed us to refine our recruitment strategy, focusing on hiring employees who are a better fit for both the role and company culture.

**Enhanced Employee Experience:** We analyzed data related to employee satisfaction, work-life balance, and benefits to uncover areas where the employee experience could be improved. The improvements in these areas contributed to higher retention rates and overall employee satisfaction.

**Increased Workforce Productivity:** Through insights into employee performance and engagement, we implemented changes that led to increased productivity. These changes were designed to support employees’ strengths while addressing areas that needed development.

**Gained Employee Trust:** Transparency in data sharing and improvements in work conditions based on the analytics helped build trust between the organization and its employees. By acting on insights provided by the dashboard, the company demonstrated a commitment to employee well-being and career growth.

****Project Scope:****
**Objective:** The project aimed to create a comprehensive HR Analytics dashboard using Power BI to monitor and analyze employee data, focusing on attrition and its driving factors.

**Key Metrics Analyzed:**
Total number of employees
Attrition analysis broken down by:
- Age
- Salary Slab
- Years at Company
- Job Role
- Departments
- Performance Rating
- The dashboard helps HR teams identify patterns and trends in attrition, allowing them to make data-driven decisions to retain top talent and improve overall employee satisfaction.

**Tools Used:**
Power BI: For data visualization and building interactive dashboards.
HRIS (Human Resource Information System): To gather and manage employee data.
The dashboard’s interactive nature allows HR teams to filter data, drill down into specific categories (e.g., age or job role), and visualize trends over time. This has proven instrumental in reducing attrition and creating a more engaged, productive workforce.
